Hi! The new text file is just for practicing.
 Git commands will be saved in here:

1. git init: to initialize a repo in folder of your wish.
2. git add : to add new files which are untracked by git.
3. git commit: to stage the changes to be included in git.
4. git checkout -b <branch_name> : to create new branch and will move to that branch.
5. git branch: shows all branch.
6. git remote add origin <address> : adding locally built repo onto github.
7. git push -u origin <main_branch> : pushes changes on master branch.
   So, to push your changes to the remote repository, you could've used either t   he command: git push git@github.com:git/git.git yourbranchname or git push or   igin yourbranchname
8. git pull origin master : recent changes get reflected.
